- **Semantic memory integration** - Works with existing memory system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x setup-content-aware-system.sh
./setup-content-aware-system.sh
```

### 2. Add Your OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Edit .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 4. Test Content-Aware Features
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Log in or register
3. Click "Content Demo" in navigation
4. Play the sample video
5. Ask questions about the content

## 🎯 Key Features to Test

### Content Awareness
- **Real-time context updates** as video progresses
- **Content-specific starter questions** based on what's being watched
- **AI references to timestamps** and video content

### Sample Questions to Try
- "Can you explain what's being discussed right now?"
- "How does this apply to my 3rd grade classroom?"
- "Can you jump back to where they first mentioned this?"
- "What should I remember from this section?"

### Expected AI Responses
- "I see you're at 2:34 where the instructor explains prompt engineering..."
- "Would you like to jump back to 1:15 where they first introduced this concept?"
- "This relates to what you watched at 3:42 about classroom applications..."

## 🧪 Validation

Run the validation script to ensure everything is working:
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x validate-content-aware-setup.sh
./validate-content-aware-setup.sh
```

## 📈 Research Benefits

### Enhanced Data Collection
- **Content interaction patterns** - What users watch, when they pause, what they ask
- **Context-aware conversations** - How AI awareness of content affects learning
- **Timestamp-based insights** - Which parts of content generate the most questions
- **Learning progression tracking** - How content consumption relates to concept mastery

### New Research Questions
- Does content-aware AI improve learning outcomes?
- How does timestamp-based assistance affect engagement?
- What types of content-aware questions do teachers ask most?
- How does the AI's content awareness affect trust and adoption?

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Content Processing Pipeline
1. Video content gets processed into 60-second chunks
2. Each chunk gets embeddings for semantic search
3. Keywords and topics extracted automatically
4. Context cached for performance

### AI Integration
1. User's current timestamp sent with each message
2. Relevant content chunk retrieved via RAG
3. Enhanced prompt includes content context
4. AI can suggest timestamp navigation

### Memory System Integration
- Content context flows into semantic memory
- Learning buddy remembers what you watched
- Connections made between content and personal learning journey
- Progressive relationship building enhanced with content awareness

## 🎉 Success Metrics

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Video won't load"** - Check file paths in uploads directory
2. **"AI not content-aware"** - Verify content context is being sent to API
3. **"Timestamp errors"** - Check video chunking and processing
4. **"Memory issues"** - Ensure database tables were created correctly

### Debug Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - System status including content-aware features
- `GET /api/debug/memory/:userId` - Memory system debugging
- `POST /api/content/video-context` - Test content context retrieval

### Console Debugging
- Check browser console for content context updates
- Monitor network tab for API calls
- Look for content-aware logs in backend console
