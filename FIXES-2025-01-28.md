# Authentication Fixes Summary
Date: 2025-01-28

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Always Using Same User
**Problem**: All logins were going to the same user regardless of credentials
**Cause**: Frontend was trying to access `response.data.userId` but server returns `response.data.user.id`
**Fix**: Updated auth page to use correct path: `response.data.user.id`

### 2. Token Confusion
**Problem**: Tokens appeared identical but were actually different
**Cause**: All JWT tokens start with the same header `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`
**Resolution**: Tokens were working correctly, just looked similar at first glance

### 3. Navigation Not Showing Logged-In User
**Problem**: CMS page showed "Login/Sign Up" even when logged in
**Cause**: Auth page wasn't storing `userEmail` in localStorage, but AppLayout required it
**Fix**: Added `localStorage.setItem('userEmail', response.data.user.email)` to auth page

### 4. Incorrect Auth URLs
**Problem**: Some components referenced `/auth/login` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed all auth redirects to `/auth`

## Files Modified

1. **frontend-next/app/auth/page.tsx**
   - Fixed: Now stores `response.data.user.id` (not `userId`)
   - Added: Stores `userEmail` in localStorage

2. **frontend-next/components/AppLayout.tsx**
   - Fixed: Redirects to `/auth` (not `/auth/login`)

3. **backend/server.js**
   - Already had: Auto-grants creator permissions to all users

## Test Users Available

- `alice@school.edu` / `alice123`
- `bob@school.edu` / `bob123`
- `test@example.com` / `password123`

## How to Test

1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Login with any test user
3. Verify:
   - Navigation shows "Welcome, [Name]" with logout button
   - Different users maintain separate sessions
   - CMS page is accessible with pencil icon

## Next Steps

- Consider adding proper role-based permissions (admin, creator, viewer)
- Add user profile page
- Implement "Remember me" functionality
- Add password reset flow
