# Prompt Engineering for Teachers

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI tools. Think of it as learning to communicate clearly with a very capable but very literal assistant.

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

### 1. Context
Provide relevant background information:
- **Grade level**: "I teach 5th grade science"
- **Subject area**: "This is for a unit on ecosystems"
- **Student needs**: "My students are visual learners"

### 2. Clear Instructions
Be specific about what you want:
- ❌ Vague: "Help me with a lesson"
- ✅ Specific: "Create a 45-minute lesson plan on the water cycle"

### 3. Format Requirements
Specify how you want the output:
- "Provide this as a bulleted list"
- "Use language appropriate for 3rd graders"
- "Include 3 discussion questions"

### 4. Constraints or Guidelines
Set boundaries for the AI:
- "Avoid complex vocabulary"
- "Include hands-on activities"
- "Align with NGSS standards"

## Prompt Templates for Common Teaching Tasks

### Lesson Planning Template
```
I teach [GRADE] [SUBJECT]. Create a [DURATION] lesson plan on [TOPIC] that includes:
- Learning objectives
- Opening activity (5 minutes)
- Main instruction (20 minutes)
- Guided practice (15 minutes)
- Assessment strategy
Please align with [STANDARDS] and include [SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS].
```

### Differentiation Template
```
I have a student who [LEARNING NEED/CHALLENGE]. 
The class is working on [TOPIC/SKILL].
Provide 3 differentiated approaches for this student that:
- Maintain the same learning objective
- Adjust for [SPECIFIC ACCOMMODATION]
- Can be implemented alongside regular instruction
```

### Assessment Creation Template
```
Create a [TYPE OF ASSESSMENT] for [GRADE] students on [TOPIC].
Include:
- [NUMBER] questions at different difficulty levels
- Answer key with point values
- Rubric for open-ended questions
Focus on assessing [SPECIFIC SKILLS/CONCEPTS].
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Refinement
Start broad, then narrow:
1. First prompt: "Create a science experiment about plants"
2. Follow-up: "Make it suitable for 2nd graders"
3. Refine: "Adapt it for a 30-minute class period"

### Role-Playing
Ask AI to assume a specific perspective:
- "Act as a curious 7th grader and ask questions about this topic"
- "Respond as a subject matter expert explaining to parents"
- "Pretend you're a student who doesn't understand and needs help"

### Chain of Thought
For complex tasks, break them down:
```
First, list the key concepts in photosynthesis.
Then, identify common misconceptions.
Finally, create activities that address each misconception.
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Information Overload
❌ "Create a lesson plan for teaching math to 4th graders covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, and word problems in one class."

✅ "Create a 45-minute lesson plan for teaching 4th graders how to add fractions with like denominators."

### 2. Assuming Too Much Context
❌ "Improve this lesson" (without providing the lesson)

✅ "Here's my current lesson plan [PASTE PLAN]. Suggest improvements for engaging kinesthetic learners."

### 3. Not Checking Output
Always review AI-generated content for:
- Accuracy of information
- Age-appropriateness
- Alignment with your teaching style
- Cultural sensitivity

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Prompt
Write a prompt to get AI to create a warm-up activity for your class.

### Exercise 2: Refinement
Take an AI response and write a follow-up prompt to improve it.

### Exercise 3: Complex Task
Create a prompt that asks AI to develop a week-long project-based learning unit.

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep a prompt library**: Save effective prompts for reuse
2. **Share with colleagues**: Build a school-wide prompt repository
3. **Iterate and improve**: Refine prompts based on results
4. **Teach students**: Help students learn prompt engineering too

## Ethical Considerations

- Always review and verify AI-generated content
- Don't rely solely on AI for sensitive topics
- Maintain your professional judgment
- Give credit when using AI-generated materials

## Your Turn

Now that you understand prompt engineering basics, try creating prompts for:
1. Tomorrow's lesson introduction
2. A parent communication email
3. A creative writing assignment

Remember: The better your prompt, the more helpful the AI response!
