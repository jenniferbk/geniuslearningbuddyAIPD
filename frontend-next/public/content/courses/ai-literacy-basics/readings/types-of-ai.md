# Types of AI: From Narrow to General

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence isn't a monolithic concept - it comes in different forms and capabilities. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for educators who want to integrate AI effectively into their teaching practice.

## Narrow AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence - ANI)

### What is it?
Narrow AI, also called Weak AI, refers to AI systems designed to perform specific tasks. These are the AI systems we interact with daily.

### Examples in Education:
- **Grammarly**: Checks grammar and writing style
- **Khan Academy's Khanmigo**: Provides personalized tutoring in specific subjects
- **Duolingo**: Adapts language lessons to individual learners
- **Turnitin**: Detects plagiarism in student submissions

### Key Characteristics:
- Excels at one specific task
- Cannot transfer knowledge to other domains
- Operates within predefined parameters
- Currently the only type of AI that exists

## General AI (Artificial General Intelligence - AGI)

### What is it?
AGI refers to hypothetical AI systems that would match or exceed human intelligence across all domains. This is still theoretical and doesn't exist yet.

### Potential Capabilities:
- Understanding and learning any intellectual task
- Transferring knowledge between domains
- Creative problem-solving
- Self-awareness and consciousness

### Timeline:
Experts disagree on when (or if) AGI will be achieved. Estimates range from 10 years to never.

## Implications for Educators

### Today's Reality:
- All current AI tools are narrow AI
- Each tool has specific strengths and limitations
- Multiple tools may be needed for different tasks

### Practical Considerations:
1. **Choose the right tool for the task**: A math tutoring AI won't help with creative writing
2. **Understand limitations**: AI tools can't replace human judgment and creativity
3. **Combine multiple tools**: Use different AI systems for different classroom needs

## Discussion Questions

1. How might the distinction between narrow and general AI affect your approach to using AI tools in the classroom?
2. What are the benefits and limitations of narrow AI for education?
3. How should educators prepare students for a future that might include AGI?
